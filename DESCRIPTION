Title: Use Equality Assignment for Immutability
Version: 0.1
Author: Stefan Milton Bache
Maintainer: Stefan Milton Bache <stefan@stefanbache.dk>
Description: When `=` is used for assignment immutability is emulated by
  assigning an active binding to the symbol that will raise an error if
  reuse of the symbol is attempted. This allows the use of `=` as a promise
  that the value will not change within it's scope.
